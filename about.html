      <h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr/><br/>
      <p>
        It is I, Kelp Thing! Do what I do! 
				<br/>
				Just kidding.
				<br/><br/>
				Hello and welcome to Musichondrium - The Power-House of the Cell-- I mean the Home of Electronic Dance Music!
				<br/>
				I'm Krizmand Ydore Acebo of 9-Samat and I am the creator of this site. 
				I like lotsa things, including but not limited to the following: Computers (Both CS and Programming), 
	      Music (Typically Electronic Music) and Music Production, Video Games (Minecraft, Arras.io, Tekken), 
				SpongeBob SquarePants (The TV Show, as a whole), and my... uh... 3-18-21-18-8, who is... like I would tell you!
	                        Hah! Still kidding. Know it for yourself. It's an easter egg in this site.
	                        <br/><br/>
	                        No, I will not help you find it. It's a secret.
				<br/>
      </p>

			<h4>Why did I create Musichondrium?</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Two things: Passion and, you've guessed it, Grades.
				<br/><br/>
				For the passion part...
				<br/><br/>
				Like I've stated earlier, I like to listen to and create music, specifically electronic dance music, so 
				I created a website about it. 
				<br/>
				EDM is literally the only thing that I could make a good website about anyway... other than video games, that is, which 
				two of my friends already did. 
				<br/><br/>
				For the grades part, on the other hand... well... that's kinda self-explanatory. Who wants to fail?
				<br/><br/>
				Some Rando: "Me!"
				<br/><br/>
				Me: "Well, nothing can do about that."
				<br/><br/>
				Anyway, I am really really proud of my work (this site) sooo I hope you appreciate it. 
				<br/>
				Enjoy your visit here!
